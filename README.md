# qBay
This prototype works by asking for a hardcoded username and password.
Once these are properly provided, it allows the user to buy, sell, look at their cart, or log out.
Selecting buy allows the user to buy any of the five hardcoded items for sale.
Selecting sell allows the user to sell new items.
Selecting cart allows the user to view their cart.
Selecting logout causes the application to close.
